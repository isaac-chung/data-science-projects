# Predicting Used Car Prices in Toronto
This mini-project predicts used sedan prices in Toronto using Machine Learning models trained with Autotrader data. This was used for a short 5-8 minute demo in an data-science related interview. The purpose of the project is to showcase how specific Python libraries are used for
* Web Scraping
* Data Manipulation
* Data Cleaning
* Data Visualization
* Feature Engineering
* Model Seletcion
* Predictions

in a simple regression problem. 

## Dependencies
Make sure all dependencies are installed from 'requirements.txt'. 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
This project has two files:
* a python [script](https://github.com/isaac-chung/data-science-projects/blob/master/Predicting-Used-Car-Prices-in-Toronto/webscraper.py) that contains a template for web scraping
* a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/isaac-chung/data-science-projects/blob/master/Predicting-Used-Car-Prices-in-Toronto/Used-car-demo.ipynb) containing the annotated end-to-end data science demo

Assumptions made are stated in the notebook markups.
